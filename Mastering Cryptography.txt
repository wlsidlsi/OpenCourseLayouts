## 1. Introduction to Cryptography
### 1.1. History of Cryptography
#### 1.1.1 Ancient Cryptography
Cryptography, the art and science of keeping information secret, has been practiced for centuries. Ancient civilizations developed various techniques to protect confidential messages, from simple substitution ciphers to more sophisticated systems.

##### 1.1.2 Early Techniques

**Symbolism and Pictograms:** The earliest forms of cryptography involved using symbols or pictograms to represent words or concepts. For example, the ancient Egyptians used hieroglyphs to encode secret messages.

**Substitution Ciphers:** In a substitution cipher, each letter in the cleartext (original message) is replaced by a different letter in the ciphertext (encoded message). The famous Caesar cipher, used by Julius Caesar, shifted each letter forward three positions in the alphabet.

##### 1.1.3 Mesopotamian and Egyptian Cryptography

**Mesopotamian Cuneiform Writing:** The Mesopotamians developed a script known as cuneiform, which was used for administrative and diplomatic purposes. Secret messages were often written using logographic signs, where each symbol represented a complete word or concept.

**Egyptian Hieratic and Demotic Scripts:** Ancient Egyptians developed hieratic and demotic scripts, which were more cursive and simplified versions of hieroglyphs. These scripts were used for faster writing and were often used for secret correspondence.

##### 1.1.4 Greek and Roman Cryptography

**Spartan Scytale:** The Spartans used a device called the scytale to encrypt military messages. The message was wrapped around a rod of specific diameter, and then only the sender and receiver had rods of the same diameter to decipher the message.

**Vigenère Cipher:** The Vigenère cipher, developed in the 16th century, was considered unbreakable for centuries. It used a repeating key to encrypt messages, combining substitution ciphers for each letter.

##### 1.2 Chinese Cryptography

**Zhuanzhu Cipher:** The Zhuanzhu cipher, used during the Warring States period (475-221 BC), involved rotating a grid of characters to encrypt messages.

**Yuan Shu Cipher:** The Yuan Shu cipher, developed in the 3rd century AD, used a series of complex rules to substitute and rearrange characters. It was said to be so complex that only the emperor's highest officials could decipher it.

##### 1.3 Cryptography in Communication

Ancient cryptography played a crucial role in warfare, diplomacy, and espionage. Encrypted messages allowed armies to communicate and coordinate their movements without their enemies intercepting the information. Diplomats used cryptography to convey sensitive messages between countries.

##### 1.4 Legacy and Evolution

The principles of ancient cryptography have influenced modern encryption techniques. Substitution ciphers are still used in some basic cryptographic systems, while more advanced algorithms inspired by ancient methods have been developed to meet the security challenges of the digital age.

### 1.2. Fundamental Concepts
#### 1.2.1 Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability in Cryptography 

**Confidentiality**

Confidentiality, in the context of cryptography, is the property that ensures that information is only accessible to authorized parties. It prevents unauthorized individuals or entities from reading or obtaining sensitive or private data. To achieve confidentiality, encryption is commonly used, where plaintext or unencrypted information is transformed into ciphertext or encrypted data. Encryption algorithms, such as AES and DES, are designed to make the plaintext virtually impossible to decipher without the correct cryptographic key.

**Integrity**

Integrity, in a cryptographic context, refers to the trustworthiness and accuracy of information. It ensures that data has not been modified, tampered with, or corrupted in any way during transmission or storage. To guarantee integrity, cryptographic mechanisms like message authentication codes (MACs) and digital signatures are employed. These techniques allow for the detection of any unauthorized changes made to the data, as they produce a unique fingerprint or signature that is tied to the original message and can be verified by authorized recipients.

**Availability**

Availability, in the context of cryptography, ensures that authorized parties have access to information and systems when needed. It prevents unauthorized individuals or entities from disrupting or denying access to critical data or services. To achieve availability, various techniques are employed, including redundant storage, disaster recovery plans, and access control mechanisms. These measures aim to minimize the risk of data loss, system failures, and unauthorized access, ensuring that authorized users can rely on the availability of information when they need it.

#### 1.2.2 Authentication and Non-repudiation

**Authentication** and **non-repudiation** are two important security concepts that are closely related to each other.

**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user or device. This is typically done by checking the user's credentials, such as a username and password, against a database of known users. Once a user has been authenticated, they are granted access to the system or resource that they requested.

**Non-repudiation** is the ability to prove that a user or device has performed a specific action. This is important in cases where it is necessary to hold someone accountable for their actions. For example, a non-repudiation mechanism could be used to prove that a user signed a contract or sent an email.

There are a number of different ways to implement authentication and non-repudiation. Some of the most common methods include:

* **Passwords:** Passwords are the most common method of authentication. They are easy to use and understand, but they are also relatively insecure.
* **Biometrics:** Biometrics, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, and voice recognition, are more secure than passwords. However, they can be more difficult to use and they can be expensive to implement.
* **Tokens:** Tokens are small devices that generate a unique code that can be used to authenticate a user. Tokens are more secure than passwords, but they can be lost or stolen.
* **Certificates:** Certificates are digital documents that contain information about a user's identity. Certificates are used to authenticate users in a variety of applications, such as web browsers and email clients.

The choice of authentication and non-repudiation mechanism depends on the specific requirements of the application.

Here are some of the benefits of using authentication and non-repudiation:

* **Improved security:** Authentication and non-repudiation mechanisms help to protect systems and resources from unauthorized access.
* **Increased accountability:** Authentication and non-repudiation mechanisms make it possible to hold users accountable for their actions.
* **Reduced risk of fraud:** Authentication and non-repudiation mechanisms help to reduce the risk of fraud by making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access systems and resources.

#### 1.2.3 Cryptographic Primitives and Protocols

**Cryptographic Primitives**

* **Symmetric Encryption (e.g., AES, DES)**: Encrypts/decrypts plaintext using the same secret key.
* **Asymmetric Encryption (e.g., RSA, ElGamal)**: Uses two different keys (public and private) for encryption and decryption.
* **Hash Functions (e.g., SHA-256, MD5)**: Computes a fixed-length digest from an input message; used for data integrity and verification.
* **Message Authentication Codes (e.g., HMAC)**: Verifies the authenticity and integrity of a message using a secret key.
* **Random Number Generators (RNGs)**: Generate unpredictable and random numbers for cryptographic purposes.

**Cryptographic Protocols**

* **Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: Establishes encrypted channels for secure communication over networks.
* **Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)/RSA Signature:** Provides digital signatures for verifying the authenticity and origin of electronic documents.
* **Key Exchange Protocols (e.g., Diffie-Hellman)**: Enables two parties to establish a secure and shared cryptographic key over an insecure channel.
* **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Allow one party to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself.
* **Anonymous Credentials:** Provide verifiable credentials without revealing the identity of the holder.

**Applications**

* Secure messaging and communication
* Data protection and encryption
* Digital signatures and authentication

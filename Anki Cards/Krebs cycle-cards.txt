<b>Krebs cycle</b> | The Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle or the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is a key metabolic pathway that occurs in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells.
<b>Krebs cycle</b> | The cycle begins with the condensation of acetyl-CoA with oxaloacetate to form citrate.
<b>Krebs cycle</b> | Citrate is then isomerized to isocitrate.
<b>Krebs cycle</b> | Isocitrate is then oxidized to α-ketoglutarate.
<b>Krebs cycle</b> | α-Ketoglutarate is then oxidized to succinyl-CoA.
<b>Krebs cycle</b> | Succinyl-CoA is then converted to succinate.
<b>Krebs cycle</b> | Succinate is then oxidized to fumarate.
<b>Krebs cycle</b> | Fumarate is then hydrated to malate.
<b>Krebs cycle</b> | Malate is then oxidized to oxaloacetate.
<b>Krebs cycle</b> | The cycle then repeats itself.
<b>Krebs cycle</b> | The Krebs cycle is a major source of energy for cells.
<b>Krebs cycle</b> | The Krebs cycle also plays a role in the synthesis of amino acids, nucleotides, and other molecules.
<b>Krebs cycle</b> | The Krebs cycle is regulated by a number of factors, including the availability of substrates, the concentration of NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH, and the activity of key enzymes.
<b>Krebs cycle</b> | The Krebs cycle is a complex and essential metabolic pathway.

		•	Landing procedures (autonomous drone ships, RTLS)
		•	Challenges and reliability concerns
	3.	Mission Control and Telemetry Systems
		•	Role of mission control in pre-launch, launch, and post-launch
		•	Key data points (altitude, velocity, engine status)
		•	Using open-source or publicly available telemetry for analysis
	4.	Spacecraft Design and Payload Capabilities
		•	Dragon spacecraft (cargo and crew variations)
		•	Capsule design vs. winged spacecraft
		•	Environmental control and life support systems
	5.	Orbital Maneuvers and Spacecraft Operations

		•	In-orbit refueling concepts
		•	Debris mitigation and compliance with space traffic management

### Suggested Activities & Assessments
	•	Activity: Analyze telemetry data from a recorded Falcon 9 launch to chart altitude, velocity, and booster landing.
	•	Case Study: Create a mock payload integration plan for a small satellite to be launched on a Falcon 9.
	•	Group Presentation: Compare SpaceX’s reusability approach to that of competitors (e.g., Blue Origin’s New Shepard or ULA’s Vulcan).

## Advanced Level

### Objectives
	•	Investigate SpaceX’s human spaceflight program and its ambitious plans for Mars exploration.
	•	Critically assess legal, environmental, and sustainability issues in commercial spaceflight.
	•	Develop strategic thinking for future mission proposals.

### Topics
	1.	SpaceX’s Human Spaceflight Program
		•	Crew Dragon design, safety measures, and ISS missions
		•	Starlink constellation: technical structure, global internet coverage, and potential concerns
	2.	Mission Planning and Execution
		•	Scientific missions (e.g., launching research payloads)
		•	Exploration missions (Moon to Mars transfer)
		•	Interplanetary trajectory planning (Hohmann transfers, gravity assists)
	3.	Future Starship Missions and Mars Exploration
		•	Detailed Starship architecture, in-orbit refueling concepts
		•	Life support, radiation shielding, and closed-loop ecosystems
		•	Potential timelines and engineering challenges for crewed Mars missions
	4.	Sustainability and Environmental Considerations
		•	Environmental impact of frequent rocket launches
		•	Space debris and orbital crowding (Starlink concerns)
		•	Reusability as a sustainability measure
	5.	Legal and Regulatory Frameworks
		•	International treaties (Outer Space Treaty) and national regulations (FAA, FCC)
		•	Licensing, liability, and insurance for commercial launches
		•	Ethical considerations of human settlement on Mars

### Suggested Activities & Assessments
	•	Team Project: Draft a detailed Mars mission plan using Starship, including hardware, timelines, and risk mitigation strategies.
	•	Debate: Split into groups to argue for or against stringent regulations on mega-constellations like Starlink.
	•	Research Paper/Presentation: Analyze the legal frameworks governing commercial spaceflight and propose improvements or policy changes to address new challenges.

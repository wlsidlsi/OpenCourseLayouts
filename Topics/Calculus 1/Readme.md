I created this by request a list of topics for a given subject using mac shortcut.

"Respond only with the following no suplurfous tex or formattingt => new line delimited list of topics covering "Repeat Item" from foundation to mastery.  Do not add a introuductory paragraph  or headers keep consise and plaintext only.  Each line must relate to the topic to the subject directly with the subject in the line."

Then I passed this list of topics to my create syllabus for each line.

"Respond only with the following no suplurfous text => In the syle of technical college courses create a syllbus of topics (only) from foundation to master for "Repeat Item" Do not add a introuductory paragraph keep the the syllabus only concise but extensive and formal using markdown."

After I got a lot of files with different syllabus I greped all the the topics and put into Gemini asking to logically sort by progression for learning the subject that is what is output in => "Topics_Organized_by_Logical_Learning_Progression.txt"

**SpaceX Starships Foundation: Types of SpaceX Ships**

**Introduction**

SpaceX is a private American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company founded by Elon Musk. The company's ultimate goal is to make humanity a multiplanetary species by enabling low-cost, reusable transportation to and from Earth and Mars. SpaceX's Starship program is a fully reusable spacecraft system designed to transport humans and cargo to Mars and beyond.

**Types of SpaceX Starships**

The Starship system consists of two primary components:

* **Starship (spaceship)**:  The upper-stage, reusable spacecraft designed to carry crew and cargo.
* **Super Heavy (rocket)**:  The lower-stage, reusable rocket that launches Starship into orbit.

**Starship**

* **Length:** 50 m (164 ft)
* **Diameter:** 9 m (30 ft)
* **Payload capacity:** 100 metric tons (220,000 lb) to LEO
* **Number of engines:** 6 Raptor engines
* **Thrust:** 1,200 metric tons (2,600,000 lbf)
* **Propulsion:** Liquid methane (CH4) and liquid oxygen (LOX)

**Super Heavy**

* **Length:** 70 m (230 ft)
* **Diameter:** 9 m (30 ft)
* **Payload capacity:** 220 metric tons (490,000 lb) to LEO
* **Number of engines:** 33 Raptor engines
* **Thrust:** 7,200 metric tons (16,000,000 lbf)
* **Propulsion:** Liquid methane (CH4) and liquid oxygen (LOX)

**Other SpaceX Ships**

In addition to Starship and Super Heavy, SpaceX has developed several other types of reusable spacecraft:

* **Dragon 2 (cargo)**: A reusable cargo spacecraft that has delivered supplies to the International Space Station (ISS).
* **Dragon 2 (crew)**: A reusable spacecraft that carries astronauts to and from the ISS.
* **Crew Dragon XL**: A larger variant of the Crew Dragon, designed to carry up to 8 astronauts.
* **Falcon 9**: A reusable rocket that has been used to launch satellites, cargo, and astronauts into orbit.
* **Falcon Heavy**: A more powerful variant of the Falcon 9, capable of launching heavier payloads into orbit.

**Conclusion**

SpaceX's Starship system is a revolutionary spacecraft designed to enable low-cost, reusable transportation to and from Earth and Mars. The system consists of two primary components: Starship (the spacecraft) and Super Heavy (the rocket). SpaceX has also developed several other types of reusable spacecraft, including Dragon 2, Crew Dragon XL, Falcon 9, and Falcon Heavy. These ships are playing a vital role in SpaceX's mission to make humanity a multiplanetary species.

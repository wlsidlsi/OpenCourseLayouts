**SpaceX Starship Propulsion Systems**

**Engine Types**

* **Raptor Vacuum:** Vacuum-optimized Raptor engine for upper stages
* **Raptor Sea Level:** Sea-level version of Raptor engine for takeoff and landing
* **Methalox:** Propellant combination of methane (CH4) and liquid oxygen (LOX)

**Engine Design**

* **Full-Flow Staged Combustion (FFSC):** Combustion takes place in two stages, increasing efficiency
* **Liquid Oxygen Preburner:** LOX is burned with methane in a separate preburner, creating hot gas to drive the main turbopumps
* **Methane-Rich Preburner:** Methane is burned in the preburner to reduce soot formation

**Propulsion System Architecture**

* **Primary Propulsion:** Raptor engines arranged in a cluster for main propulsion
* **Reaction Control System (RCS):** Small Draco thrusters for maneuvering and attitude control
* **Landing Thrusters:** Dedicated thrusters on the Starship's base for controlled landings

**Propulsion Performance**

* **Specific Impulse:**
    * Raptor Vacuum: ~382 s
    * Raptor Sea Level: ~330 s
* **Thrust:**
    * Raptor Vacuum: ~2,300 kN (525,000 lbf)
    * Raptor Sea Level: ~1,850 kN (419,000 lbf)
* **Propellant Load:**
    * Starship at launch: ~1,200 tons of methalox

**Propulsion Challenges**

* **Soot Formation:** The combustion of methane can produce soot, which can clog nozzles and reduce engine performance
* **Raptor Engine Testing:** Developing and testing the Raptor engines has been a major engineering challenge
* **Fueling and Handling:** Methane and LOX are cryogenic propellants that require specialized handling and storage

**Future Propulsion Developments**

* **Reusable Upper Stage Engines:** Developing reusable Raptor engines for the Starship's upper stage
* **Propellant Depots:** Establishing propellant depots in space to reduce the amount of propellant needed for certain missions
* **Advanced Propellants:** Exploring alternative propellants, such as liquid hydrogen and oxygen, for future Starship variants

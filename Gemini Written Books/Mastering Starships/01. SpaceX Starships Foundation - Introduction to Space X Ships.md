**SpaceX Starships**

**Introduction**

SpaceX Starships is a fully reusable launch system being developed by SpaceX, with the goal of providing reliable and affordable access to space for both crewed and cargo missions. It consists of two primary components: the Starship spacecraft and the Super Heavy booster.

**Starship**

* **Overview:** The Starship spacecraft is a large and versatile vehicle designed for both orbital and deep space missions. It is powered by six Raptor engines and has the capacity to transport up to 100 passengers or significant cargo payloads.
* **Structure:** The Starship is made of stainless steel and features a cylindrical fuselage with two aerodynamic fins and a blunt nose cone. It consists of a crew cabin, a cargo bay, and a propulsion system.
* **Propulsion:** The Starship is powered by six Raptor 2 engines, which use liquid methane and liquid oxygen as fuel. These engines are capable of providing up to 1,700 tons of thrust each.
* **Capabilities:** The Starship is designed to be fully reusable, allowing it to land back on Earth after completing a mission. It is also capable of refueling in orbit, extending its range and capabilities.

**Super Heavy**

* **Overview:** The Super Heavy booster is the first stage of the Starships launch system. Its primary purpose is to lift the Starship into orbit.
* **Structure:** The Super Heavy is a large and powerful rocket, with a height of over 70 meters and a diameter of 9 meters. It is made of stainless steel and features a cluster of 33 Raptor 2 engines at its base.
* **Propulsion:** The Super Heavy is powered by 33 Raptor 2 engines, which provide up to 7,200 tons of thrust at sea level. This immense thrust allows it to lift the Starship and itself into orbit.
* **Capabilities:** The Super Heavy is designed to be reusable, enabling it to land back on Earth after separating from the Starship. It also has the potential to be used for other launch missions in the future.

**Applications**

SpaceX Starships is intended for a wide range of space missions, including:

* Crew transportation to and from the International Space Station and other orbital destinations
* Cargo delivery to Earth orbit, the Moon, and Mars
* Deep space exploration and scientific research
* Human settlement on Mars and other celestial bodies

**Current Status**

As of January 2023, SpaceX Starships is still under development. Several prototypes have been built and tested, including Starhopper and Starship SN8 through SN16. SpaceX is currently preparing for an orbital test flight of Starship in 2023.

**Future Plans**

SpaceX has ambitious plans for Starships, including:

* Establishing a regular transportation service to the International Space Station
* Sending crewed missions to the Moon and Mars
* Developing new technologies for advanced propulsion and in-space operations
* Enabling the development of a permanent human presence on Mars

## 02. SpaceX Starships Foundation - History and Development

SpaceX's Starship is a reusable spacecraft and super heavy-lift launch vehicle system designed to replace the company's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. It is intended to be used for a variety of purposes, including satellite deployment, human spaceflight to the Moon and Mars, and point-to-point travel on Earth.

**History**

The development of Starship began in 2012 as a concept for a reusable spacecraft that could be used to transport humans to Mars. The first prototype, known as Starhopper, was built in 2019 and performed a series of short hops in Texas.

In 2020, SpaceX began construction of a full-scale Starship prototype, known as SN1, at its Boca Chica, Texas facility. SN1 was destroyed during a pressure test in November 2020, but subsequent prototypes, SN2 and SN3, were successfully tested in February and March 2021, respectively.

**Development**

Starship is a two-stage rocket system. The first stage, known as Super Heavy, is a reusable booster that will lift the second stage, known as Starship, into orbit. Super Heavy is powered by 28 Raptor engines, and Starship is powered by 6 Raptor engines.

Starship is designed to be fully reusable, meaning that both the first and second stages can be landed back on Earth after each flight. This will significantly reduce the cost of spaceflight.

Starship is also designed to be very versatile. It can be used to transport satellites, humans, or cargo to orbit. It can also be used to perform point-to-point travel on Earth, which could revolutionize air travel.

**Current Status**

As of March 2021, SpaceX is continuing to develop Starship. The company is currently building a new prototype, known as SN4, which is expected to perform a test flight in the coming months.

SpaceX is also working on the development of a launch pad for Starship at Boca Chica, Texas. The launch pad is expected to be completed in 2022.

**Future Plans**

SpaceX plans to begin commercial flights with Starship in 2023. The company has already signed contracts with several customers, including NASA and the Japanese space agency JAXA.

SpaceX also plans to use Starship to send humans to the Moon and Mars. The company has said that it hopes to land humans on the Moon by 2024 and on Mars by 2026.

**Conclusion**

Starship is a revolutionary spacecraft that has the potential to change the way we travel and explore space. SpaceX is making significant progress in the development of Starship, and the company is on track to begin commercial flights in the coming years.

## useReducer Hook

### Overview

`useReducer` is a React Hook that manages state using a reducer function. Unlike `useState` which can only handle simple state updates, `useReducer` allows for complex state transformations and the use of multiple state variables.

### How to Use

```
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

- `reducer` is a pure function that takes the current state and an action (an object with a type property) and returns the updated state.
- `initialState` is the initial value of the state. It can be any value, but it's typically an object.

### Example

Let's create a simple counter with a `useReducer` hook.

```
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const Counter = () => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Count: {state.count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
    </>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

### Benefits of Using `useReducer`

- **Complex state transformations:** `useReducer` allows for complex state transformations that can involve multiple state variables.
- **Centralized state management:** All state updates are handled in the reducer function, making it easier to maintain and debug your application's state.
- **Performance:** `useReducer` can improve performance by batching state updates, which reduces the number of renders.
- **Testing:** The reducer function can be easily tested, which makes it easier to test the state logic of your application.

### When to Use `useReducer`

`useReducer` is a good choice when you:

- Need to manage complex state transformations involving multiple state variables.
- Want to centralize your state management in a single location.
- Need to improve the performance of your application by batching state updates.
- Want to easily test the state logic of your application.

### When to Use `useState`

`useState` is a good choice when you:

- Need to manage simple state updates.
- Don't need to perform complex state transformations.
- Don't need to centralize your state management in a single location.
- Don't need to improve the performance of your application by batching state updates.
- Don't need to easily test the state logic of your application.

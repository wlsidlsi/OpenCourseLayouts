## Lists and Keys - Index as Key Caveats

### Overview

In Python, lists and keys can both behave like dictionaries in that they can map a key to a value. However, there are some important caveats to be aware of when using an index as a key in a list.

### Index as Key Caveats

1. **Lists are mutable, while keys are immutable.** This means that you can change the order of items in a list, which can affect the mapping between indices and values. For example, the following code will print `'Value 2'` because the order of the list has been changed:

```python
my_list = ['Value 1', 'Value 2']
my_dict = {0: my_list[0], 1: my_list[1]}
my_list[0], my_list[1] = my_list[1], my_list[0]
print(my_dict[0])
```

2. **Indices can be duplicated, while keys must be unique.** This means that you cannot map multiple values to the same index in a list. For example, the following code will raise a `ValueError`:

```python
my_list = ['Value 1', 'Value 2']
my_dict = {0: my_list[0], 1: my_list[1], 0: my_list[1]}
```

3. **Indices are not hashable, while keys must be hashable.** This means that you cannot use indices as keys in a dictionary. For example, the following code will raise a `TypeError`:

```python
my_dict = {0: 'Value 1', 1: 'Value 2'}
my_dict[my_list[0]] = 'Value 3'
```

### Best Practices

To avoid these caveats, it is best to use unique, immutable objects as keys in a dictionary. For example, you could use a tuple of indices instead of a single index as a key:

```python
my_list = ['Value 1', 'Value 2']
my_dict = {(0, 1): my_list[0], (1, 0): my_list[1]}
```

This would ensure that the mapping between keys and values remains consistent, even if the order of the items in the list is changed.

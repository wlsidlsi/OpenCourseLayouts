# Cryptography and Security Concepts: Basic Number Theory for Cryptography

### Overview

Cryptography, the science of securing information, relies heavily on concepts from number theory. This introduction provides a foundation in basic number theory concepts essential for understanding cryptography.

### Prime Numbers

**Definition:** A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself.

**Properties:**
- Every positive integer can be expressed uniquely as a product of prime numbers. (Prime Factorization Theorem)
- There are infinitely many prime numbers. (Prime Number Theorem)

### Integer Arithmetic

**Modulus Operator:**
- The modulus operator (%) computes the remainder when one number is divided by another.

**Modular Exponentiation:**
- Modular exponentiation is raising a number to a power modulo a third number.
- It is used extensively in cryptography for key exchange and digital signatures.

### Congruence and Modular Arithmetic

**Definition:** Two integers a and b are congruent modulo m if their difference is divisible by m.
- Notation: a ≡ b (mod m)

**Properties:**
- Congruence preserves +, -, and multiplication.
- It is used to solve systems of equations in modular arithmetic.

### Euler's Phi Function

**Definition:** Euler's Phi function (φ(n)) counts the number of integers less than n that are relatively prime to n.
- φ(p^k) = p^(k-1) * (p-1) for p prime and k ≥ 1.

### Fermat's Little Theorem

**Theorem:** If p is a prime and a is any integer, then a^p ≡ a (mod p).

**Applications:**
- Fast exponentiation in modular arithmetic.
- Testing primality.

### Inverse Congruence

**Chinese Remainder Theorem:** If m1, m2, ..., mk are pairwise coprime, then for any a1, a2, ..., ak, there exists an x such that:
- x ≡ a1 (mod m1)
- x ≡ a2 (mod m2)
- ...
- x ≡ ak (mod mk)

**Applications:**
- Solving modular equations.
- Computing modular inverses.

# Advanced Symmetric Key Algorithms and Analysis - Advanced Hash Function Design and Analysis

**Symmetric Key Algorithms**

**Block Ciphers**

* **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**: Widely used for data encryption in various applications.
* **Twofish**: Designed to be more secure than DES and AES, but slower.
* **Triple DES (3DES)**: Uses three rounds of DES to enhance security.

**Stream Ciphers**

* **RC4**: Widely used in wireless networks, but vulnerable to certain attacks.
* **Trivium**: Designed for low-power and low-latency applications.
* **HC-256**: A fast and parallelizable stream cipher.

**Modes of Operation**

* **Electronic Codebook Mode (ECB)**: Each block is encrypted independently.
* **Cipher Block Chaining Mode (CBC)**: Each block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block.
* **Cipher Feedback Mode (CFB)**: Previous ciphertext blocks are used as initialization vectors.

**Analysis**

* **Differential Cryptanalysis**: Exploits patterns in the input-output relationship.
* **Linear Cryptanalysis**: Uses linear approximations of the cipher function.
* **Brute Force Attack**: Exhaustively tries all possible key values.

**Hash Function Design and Analysis**

**Hash Functions**

* **SHA-256**: Widely used for message authentication and digital signatures.
* **MD5**: A faster hash function, but less secure than SHA-256.
* **BLAKE2**: A modern and secure hash function designed for speed and parallelism.

**Hash Table Operations**

* **Insertion**: Inserts an item into the hash table using a hash function to determine its location.
* **Lookup**: Retrieves an item from the hash table by searching for its hash value.
* **Deletion**: Removes an item from the hash table by updating the corresponding hash table entry.

**Hash Function Properties**

* **Preimage Resistance**: Given a hash value, it is difficult to find the corresponding input message.
* **Second Preimage Resistance**: Given an input message, it is difficult to find a different message with the same hash value.
* **Collision Resistance**: It is difficult to find two different input messages with the same hash value.

**Analysis**

* **Birthday Paradox**: The probability of finding a collision in a hash function increases with the number of input messages.
* **Rainbow Tables**: Precomputed tables that can be used to find collisions quickly.
* **Nonce-based Hash Functions**: Hash functions that include a random value to mitigate collision attacks.

# Asymmetric Key Cryptography: RSA, ElGamal - Key Exchange Protocols: Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic Curve

## Introduction

Asymmetric key cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, is a cryptographic system that utilizes a pair of mathematically linked keys, a **public key** and a **private key**. Unlike symmetric key cryptography, which uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, asymmetric cryptography allows for a secure exchange of messages between two parties without the need for a shared secret key.

## RSA Encryption and Decryption Algorithm

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is one of the most widely used asymmetric key encryption algorithms. It works on the principle of prime factorization and relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.

* **Key Generation:**
   * In RSA, a pair of public and private keys is generated using two randomly chosen large prime numbers, p and q.
   * The public key consists of the modulus n = pq and the public exponent e.
   * The private key consists of the private exponent d, which is calculated using e, n, p, and q.

* **Encryption:**
   * To encrypt a message M using RSA, the recipient's public key (n, e) is utilized.
   * The encrypted message, C, is calculated as: C = M^e mod n

* **Decryption:**
   * Decryption is performed using the recipient's private key (n, d).
   * The original message, M, is recovered as: M = C^d mod n

## ElGamal Encryption and Decryption Algorithm

ElGamal is another widely used asymmetric key encryption algorithm, specifically designed for secure data transmission.

* **Key Generation:**
   * In ElGamal, a pair of public and private keys is generated based on a large prime number p and a primitive root g of p.
   * The public key consists of the generator g, the prime modulus p, and the public key value Y = g^x mod p, where x is the private key.
   * The private key is x.

* **Encryption:**
   * To encrypt a message M using ElGamal, the recipient's public key (p, g, Y) is used.
   * A random number k is generated.
   * The encrypted ciphertext (C1, C2) is calculated as:
     * C1 = g^k mod p
     * C2 = Y^k * M mod p

* **Decryption:**
   * Decryption is performed using the recipient's private key (x).
   * The original message, M, is recovered as: M = C2 * (C1^x)^-1 mod p

## Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol

Diffie-Hellman is a key exchange protocol that allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel without sharing any secret information.

* **Steps:**
   1. Alice and Bob agree on a large prime number p and a primitive root g of p.
   2. Alice generates a private key a and computes A = g^a mod p.
   3. Bob generates a private key b and computes B = g^b mod p.
   4. Alice sends A to Bob.
   5. Bob sends B to Alice.
   6. Alice computes s = B^a mod p.
   7. Bob computes s = A^b mod p.
   8. Alice and Bob now have a shared secret key s, which is known only to them.

## Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is another asymmetric key encryption algorithm that is based on the mathematical properties of elliptic curves. ECC provides significant advantages in terms of key size and computational efficiency compared to RSA and ElGamal.

* **Key Generation:**
   * In ECC, a pair of public and private keys is generated using a specific elliptic curve equation.
   * The public key is a point on the curve, and the private key is a scalar that is multiplied by the point to generate the public key.

* **Encryption:**
   * To encrypt a message M using ECC, the recipient's public key is utilized.
   * The encrypted ciphertext consists of a pair of points on the elliptic curve.

* **Decryption:**
   * Decryption is performed using the recipient's private key.
   * The original message, M, is recovered by subtracting the point corresponding to the private key from the received point.

## Applications of Asymmetric Key Cryptography and Key Exchange Protocols

Asymmetric key cryptography and key exchange protocols are essential for secure communication in various applications, including:

* Digital signatures
* Secure email and messaging
* E-commerce and online transactions
* VPNs and secure tunnels
* Blockchain and cryptocurrencies

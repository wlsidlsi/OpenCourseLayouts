## Asymmetric Key Cryptography: RSA, ElGamal - Digital Signatures and Certificates

Asymmetric key cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses a pair of related keys, a public key and a private key. The public key can be shared with anyone, while the private key must be kept secret.

### RSA

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm that is widely used for secure communication. RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.

* **Key generation**: To generate an RSA key pair, a large prime number p and a large prime number q are chosen. The public key is (n, e), where n = p * q and e is a number that is relatively prime to (p-1) * (q-1). The private key is (n, d), where d is the multiplicative inverse of e modulo (p-1) * (q-1).
* **Encryption**: To encrypt a message using RSA, the sender uses the recipient's public key to encrypt the message. The encrypted message is then sent to the recipient.
* **Decryption**: The recipient uses their private key to decrypt the message.

### ElGamal

ElGamal is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm that is based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm. ElGamal is widely used for secure communication.

* **Key generation**: To generate an ElGamal key pair, a prime number p and a generator g are chosen. The public key is (p, g, h), where h = g^x mod p and x is a randomly chosen number. The private key is x.
* **Encryption**: To encrypt a message using ElGamal, the sender chooses a random number k and uses the recipient's public key to calculate C1 = g^k mod p and C2 = m * h^k mod p. The encrypted message is (C1, C2).
* **Decryption**: The recipient uses their private key to calculate m = C2 / C1^x mod p.

### Digital Signatures

A digital signature is a mathematical scheme that allows a sender to authenticate a digital message. A digital signature is created using a private key and can be verified using the corresponding public key.

* **Signing**: To sign a message, the sender uses their private key to calculate a digital signature. The digital signature is then attached to the message.
* **Verification**: The recipient uses the sender's public key to verify the digital signature. If the verification is successful, the recipient can be sure that the message was sent by the sender.

### Certificates

A certificate is a digital document that contains the public key of a user or organization. Certificates are used to verify the identity of the owner of a public key.

* **Issuing certificate**: A certificate authority (CA) issues certificates to users or organizations. The CA verifies the identity of the applicant and then issues a certificate that contains the applicant's public key.
* **Verifying certificate**: To verify a certificate, the recipient checks the signature of the CA. If the signature is valid, the recipient can be sure that the certificate is genuine.

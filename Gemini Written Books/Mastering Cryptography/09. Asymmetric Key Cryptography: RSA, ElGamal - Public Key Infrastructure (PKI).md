# Asymmetric Key Cryptography: RSA, ElGamal, PKI

## Introduction

Asymmetric key cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, is a cryptosystem that uses two different keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt messages, and the private key is used to decrypt them. This type of cryptography is used in a wide variety of applications, including secure communication, digital signatures, and electronic commerce.

## RSA

RSA is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm that was developed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in 1978. RSA is one of the most widely used asymmetric key algorithms in the world.

RSA works by using two large prime numbers, \(p\) and \(q\), to create a public key and a private key. The public key is a pair of numbers, \(e\) and \(n\), where \(e\) is a small number and \(n\) is the product of \(p\) and \(q\). The private key is a single number, \(d\), which is calculated using \(p\), \(q\), and \(e\).

To encrypt a message using RSA, the sender first converts the message into a number. They then encrypt the number using the public key. The encrypted message is then sent to the receiver.

To decrypt the message, the receiver uses their private key. The private key decrypts the message and converts it back into a number. The receiver can then read the message.

## ElGamal

ElGamal is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm that was developed by Taher ElGamal in 1985. ElGamal is similar to RSA, but it is more efficient.

ElGamal works by using a large prime number, \(p\), and a primitive root of \(p\), \(g\). The public key is a pair of numbers, \(h\) and \(g^x\), where \(h\) is a random number and \(x\) is a secret number. The private key is the number \(x\).

To encrypt a message using ElGamal, the sender first converts the message into a number. They then encrypt the number using the public key. The encrypted message is then sent to the receiver.

To decrypt the message, the receiver uses their private key. The private key decrypts the message and converts it back into a number. The receiver can then read the message.

## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a system that manages public keys and certificates. A certificate is a digital document that contains a public key and some information about the owner of the key.

PKIs are used to provide trust in public keys. When a user receives a certificate, they can be confident that the public key in the certificate belongs to the person or organization that the certificate says it does.

PKIs are used in a variety of applications, including secure communication, digital signatures, and electronic commerce.

## Conclusion

Asymmetric key cryptography is a powerful tool that can be used to protect data. RSA and ElGamal are two of the most widely used asymmetric key algorithms in the world. PKIs are used to manage public keys and certificates.

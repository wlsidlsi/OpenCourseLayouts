# Trent Reznor's Production and Collaboration Work Outside of Nine Inch Nails

This article details the production and collaboration work of Trent Reznor, primarily known as the creative force behind Nine Inch Nails, with artists outside of his main project. It will explore his distinct production style and impact on various musical projects.

## Early Collaborations and Side Projects

### Tapeworm

One of Reznor's earlier notable collaborations, **Tapeworm**, was a project initially conceived as a supergroup featuring Danny Lohner, Charlie Clouser, and several other musicians. The project aimed to be a creative outlet exploring experimental soundscapes. Despite significant studio work and multiple tracks being produced, Tapeworm ultimately remained unreleased due to creative differences and shifting priorities within the collaborators. While no formal album saw the light of day, snippets of their material and the experience influenced Reznor’s later production choices. 

### Prick

Before Tapeworm, Reznor produced, mixed, and played a variety of instruments on Prick's self-titled debut album in 1995. Prick was the project of Kevin McMahon, a former colleague of Reznor’s from the band Lucky Pierre. The album showcases a more straightforward industrial rock sound, albeit still bearing the marks of Reznor’s production techniques.

## Film Scores and Soundtrack Work

Reznor's foray into film scoring has become a significant aspect of his career outside of Nine Inch Nails. Often working alongside frequent collaborator Atticus Ross, his work in film has led to awards and critical acclaim.

### The Social Network (2010)

Reznor and Ross's score for David Fincher's *The Social Network* marked a turning point in their careers. The score, characterized by its electronic textures, ambient soundscapes, and driving rhythms, won them an Academy Award for Best Original Score. This work showcased their ability to create immersive and emotionally resonant soundscapes, separate from the more abrasive styles often associated with Nine Inch Nails. 

### The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)

Continuing their partnership with David Fincher, Reznor and Ross composed the score for *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*. The score utilizes a mix of industrial sounds, atmospheric textures, and acoustic instrumentation, creating a dark and brooding soundscape that perfectly complements the film's tone. This score also garnered critical acclaim and established their reputation for intense and nuanced sonic design for film. 

### Other Film Scores

Other notable film scores by Reznor and Ross include their work on *Gone Girl*, *Patriots Day*, and *Waves*, as well as their work on several Pixar projects like *Soul* (for which they won their second Oscar), and *Luca*. Their body of work in film highlights their versatility and adaptability as composers.

## Production for Other Artists

### Saul Williams - *The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!* (2007)

Reznor produced and co-wrote Saul Williams's 2007 album, *The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!*, a politically charged and experimental hip-hop record. This collaboration sees Reznor blending his industrial aesthetic with Williams's raw spoken word style, pushing the boundaries of both artists’ typical sounds. The album was released online under a Creative Commons license, highlighting the experimental nature of the collaboration. 

### Other Collaborations

While less extensive than his film work, Reznor has collaborated with other artists on a more limited basis, often lending his production expertise to remixes or specific tracks. These collaborations, though scattered, reveal his willingness to explore diverse genres and sounds.

## 15. State and Props - Managing State in Components

### Overview

In React, state and props are two fundamental concepts used for managing data and information in components.

### State

* **Definition:** State is a mutable, local data store that belongs to a React component.
* **Characteristics:**
    * Exclusive to the component that defines it.
    * Can be updated dynamically using `setState()`.
    * Controls the component's rendering and behavior.

### Props

* **Definition:** Props are immutable, external data passed from a parent component to its child components.
* **Characteristics:**
    * Defined in the parent component.
    * Passed to child components as parameters.
    * Cannot be modified by child components.

### Managing State

* **useState() Hook:** The `useState()` hook is used to create and maintain state in functional components. It accepts an initial state value and returns an array with the current state and a function to update it.
* **setState() Method:** In class components, the `setState()` method is used to update the component's state. It takes an object as an argument, which contains the new state values.

### Using State

* **Why use state:** State is used to manage data that is specific to a component and needs to be updated dynamically.
* **Examples:**
    * Tracking user input
    * Controlling the visibility of a component
    * Maintaining a list of items

### Using Props

* **Why use props:** Props are used to pass data from parent to child components, allowing for data flow between components.
* **Examples:**
    * Displaying data from a database in a child component
    * Passing user preferences to a child component
    * Enabling communication between parent and child components

### Best Practices

* **Keep state local:** Only store data in state that is relevant to the component.
* **Avoid shared state:** Use state to manage data within individual components, not across multiple components.
* **Use props for data flow:** Pass data from parent to child components using props, rather than accessing state directly.
* **Immutable props:** Ensure that props are passed as immutable objects to avoid unintended side effects.

## 53. State Management - Lifting State Up

### What is lifting state up?

Lifting state up is a technique in React where we move state from a child component to a parent component. This can be done to share state between multiple child components or to make the state more accessible from different parts of the application.

### When should we lift state up?

We should lift state up when:

- **The state is needed by multiple child components.** For example, if we have a list of items and we want to display a total count of the items in the header, we would need to lift the state of the list to the parent component so that the header component can access it.
- **The state needs to be accessible from different parts of the application.** For example, if we have a user settings panel and we want to display the user's name in multiple places, we would need to lift the state of the user's name to the parent component so that all the child components can access it.

### How do we lift state up?

To lift state up, we follow these steps:

1. Create a new state variable in the parent component.
2. Pass the new state variable to the child component as a prop.
3. Remove the state variable from the child component.

Here is an example of how to lift state up:

```
// Parent component
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Parent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <Child count={count} setCount={setCount} />
    </div>
  );
};

// Child component
import React from 'react';

const Child = ({ count, setCount }) => {
  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment count</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, we have lifted the `count` state up to the `Parent` component. The `Child` component now receives the `count` and `setCount` props from the `Parent` component.

### Benefits of lifting state up

- **Improved code organization.** Lifting state up can help to improve the organization of our code by separating the state from the components that use it.
- **Increased flexibility.** Lifting state up gives us more flexibility to change the implementation of our components without affecting the state management.
- **Reduced duplication.** Lifting state up can reduce duplication of state across multiple components.

### Conclusion

Lifting state up is a powerful technique that can help us to improve the organization, flexibility, and maintainability of our React applications.

## State and Props - Passing Data with Props

### Introduction

In React, data can be passed between components using props and state. Props are read-only properties that are passed from a parent component to a child component, while state is data that is managed within a component.

### Props

**Definition:** Props are short for "properties". They are immutable, read-only values that are passed from a parent component to a child component.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
<ParentComponent propName={value} />
```

**Usage:**

Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. The parent component defines the prop and the child component receives it. For example:

```javascript
// ParentComponent.js
const ParentComponent = () => {
  const propValue = "Hello World!";
  return <ChildComponent propName={propValue} />;
};

// ChildComponent.js
const ChildComponent = (props) => {
  return <div>{props.propName}</div>;
};
```

### State

**Definition:** State is data that is managed within a component. It is mutable and can be updated using the `setState()` method.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const [stateVariable, setStateVariable] = useState(initialValue);
```

**Usage:**

State is used to manage data that is internal to a component. For example:

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

const handleClick = () => {
  setCount(count + 1);
};

return (
  <div>
    <p>Count: {count}</p>
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment Count</button>
  </div>
);
```

### Passing Data with Props

**When to use props:**

Use props to pass data from a parent component to a child component when:

* The data is static and does not change over time.
* The data is only used by the child component.

**How to pass data with props:**

1. Define the prop in the parent component.
2. Pass the prop to the child component.
3. Receive the prop in the child component.

### Conclusion

Props and state are two important concepts in React for managing data. Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component, while state is used to manage data within a component. By understanding how to use props and state, you can build complex and dynamic React applications.

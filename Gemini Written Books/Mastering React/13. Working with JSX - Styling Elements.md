## Working with JSX - Styling Elements

JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code. This makes it easier to create and manage UI components. In this article, we'll discuss how to style JSX elements using CSS.

### Inline Styling

You can add inline styles to a JSX element using the `style` attribute. The following example adds a red border to a `<div>` element:

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div style={{ border: '1px solid red' }}>Hello World</div>;
};
```

You can also use inline styling to set multiple CSS properties. For example, the following example sets the font size, color, and background color of a `<p>` element:

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
  return <p style={{ fontSize: '16px', color: 'blue', backgroundColor: 'yellow' }}>Hello World</p>;
};
```

### External Stylesheets

You can also use external stylesheets to style JSX elements. To do this, you'll need to create a CSS file and link it to your JSX file. For example, the following CSS file defines a class called `my-component` that sets the font size and color of an element:

```css
.my-component {
  font-size: 16px;
  color: blue;
}
```

You can then use this class in your JSX file by adding the `className` attribute to an element. For example, the following example uses the `my-component` class to style a `<div>` element:

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div className="my-component">Hello World</div>;
};
```

### CSS Modules

CSS modules are a way to encapsulate CSS styles within a JavaScript module. This prevents styles from leaking into other parts of your application. To use CSS modules, you'll need to create a CSS file and export it as a JavaScript module. For example, the following CSS module defines a class called `my-component` that sets the font size and color of an element:

```css
// my-component.module.css
.my-component {
  font-size: 16px;
  color: blue;
}
```

You can then import this CSS module into your JSX file and use the exported class to style an element. For example, the following example uses the `my-component` class from the CSS module:

```javascript
import styles from './my-component.module.css';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div className={styles.myComponent}>Hello World</div>;
};
```

### Conclusion

Styling JSX elements is essential for creating visually appealing user interfaces. In this article, we've discussed three different ways to style JSX elements: inline styling, external stylesheets, and CSS modules. Each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages, so choose the one that best suits your needs.

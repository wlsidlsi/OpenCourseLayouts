**Component Lifecycle Methods in React**

**Introduction**

React components have a lifecycle, which refers to the different stages a component goes through during its existence. Understanding the component lifecycle is crucial for building robust and efficient React applications.

**9 Fundamentals of Component Lifecycle Methods**

1. **Mounting**
   - **componentWillMount()**: Invoked just before mounting occurs. Used for initialization and setting up references.
   - **componentDidMount()**: Invoked after the component is mounted and the DOM is updated. Used for interacting with external APIs or setting up event listeners.

2. **Updating**
   - **componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps)**: Invoked when props are updated, but before the state or DOM is updated. Used for preparing for changes and updating internal state accordingly.
   - **shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)**: Invoked before a component is updated. Returns a boolean indicating whether or not to update. Can be used for performance optimization.
   - **componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState)**: Invoked before the component is updated. Used for last-minute state or DOM updates before the actual update.
   - **componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)**: Invoked after the component is updated and the DOM is updated. Used for post-update cleanup or side-effects.

3. **Unmounting**
   - **componentWillUnmount()**: Invoked when the component is about to be unmounted. Used for cleanup tasks such as removing event listeners or canceling subscriptions.

**Usage**

Lifecycle methods should be used sparingly and only for specific tasks. Here are some guidelines:

- **Mounting**: Use for setup tasks that can be done before the component is rendered.
- **Updating**: Use for managing state updates and interacting with external APIs.
- **Unmounting**: Use for cleanup tasks and detaching from any external resources.

**Additional Notes**

- Lifecycle methods are not invoked in all cases. For example, `componentWillReceiveProps` is only invoked when props are updated, and `shouldComponentUpdate` can be implemented to prevent unnecessary updates.
- The order of lifecycle method invocations is guaranteed.
- Lifecycle methods are synchronous and should not perform asynchronous operations.

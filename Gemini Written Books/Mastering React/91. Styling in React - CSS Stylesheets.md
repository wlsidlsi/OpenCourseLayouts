## 91. Styling in React - CSS Stylesheets

**Overview**
Styling is essential for creating visually appealing and accessible UIs. React provides several ways to style components, including using CSS stylesheets. This article explores the use of CSS stylesheets for styling in React.

**Creating a CSS Stylesheet**
Create a CSS file with a `.css` extension, e.g. `styles.css`. Import the stylesheet into your React component using the `import` statement:

```javascript
import './styles.css';
```

**Applying Styles to Elements**
Use CSS class names to apply styles to specific elements. For example:

```css
.button {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

In your React component, you can add the class name to the appropriate HTML element:

```javascript
<button className="button">Click Me</button>
```

**Using CSS Modules**
CSS Modules allow you to encapsulate styles within a single file and scope them to the component using them. This helps prevent style conflicts with other components.

To use CSS Modules:
1. Create a CSS file with the same name as your component and a `.module.css` extension, e.g. `Button.module.css`.
2. Import the CSS file in your component:

```javascript
import styles from './Button.module.css';
```

3. Use the exported CSS class names:

```css
.button {
  color: red;
}
```

```javascript
<button className={styles.button}>Click Me</button>
```

**Styling with CSS-in-JS**
CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components allow you to write styles directly within your React components. This provides a high level of flexibility and control.

**Additional Tips**
* Use semantic class names to make your CSS more readable and maintainable.
* Avoid using inline styles as they are difficult to read and maintain.
* Consider using a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less for more powerful features.
* Use a CSS linter to ensure your code follows best practices.

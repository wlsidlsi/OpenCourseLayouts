**Conditional Rendering in JSX**

**Introduction**

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code directly in your JavaScript files. It provides a convenient way to create React components, which are reusable building blocks for user interfaces.

Conditional rendering allows you to dynamically display or hide certain parts of your user interface based on certain conditions. This is useful for creating interactive and responsive components.

**Syntax**

In JSX, conditional rendering is achieved using the ternary conditional operator (`? :`). The syntax is as follows:

```
{condition ? trueExpression : falseExpression}
```

Where:

* `condition` is a boolean expression that evaluates to either `true` or `false`.
* `trueExpression` is the JSX expression that will be rendered if the condition is `true`.
* `falseExpression` is the JSX expression that will be rendered if the condition is `false`.

**Examples**

**Example 1: Displaying a message based on a condition**

```
const message = isLoggedIn ? "Welcome, John Doe" : "Please log in";

ReactDOM.render(<h1>{message}</h1>, document.getElementById("root"));
```

In this example, the `message` variable is set to either "Welcome, John Doe" if the `isLoggedIn` condition is `true`, or "Please log in" if the `isLoggedIn` condition is `false`. The `message` variable is then rendered as the content of an `h1` element.

**Example 2: Hiding an element based on a condition**

```
const showButton = isVisible ? <button>Click Me</button> : null;

ReactDOM.render(showButton, document.getElementById("root"));
```

In this example, the `showButton` variable is set to a `<button>` element if the `isVisible` condition is `true`, or `null` if the `isVisible` condition is `false`. The `showButton` variable is then rendered to the DOM. If the `isVisible` condition is `false`, the button will not be displayed.

**Nested Conditionals**

You can nest multiple ternary conditional operators to create more complex conditional rendering logic. For example:

```
const message = isLoggedIn ? (
  isPremium ? 
    "Welcome, Premium Member John Doe" 
    : "Welcome, John Doe"
) : "Please log in";

ReactDOM.render(<h1>{message}</h1>, document.getElementById("root"));
```

In this example, the `message` variable is set to different values depending on the `isLoggedIn` and `isPremium` conditions.

**Conclusion**

Conditional rendering in JSX is a powerful technique that allows you to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. By using the ternary conditional operator, you can easily display or hide elements based on certain conditions. This is a valuable technique to master for any React developer.

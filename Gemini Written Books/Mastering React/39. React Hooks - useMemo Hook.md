## React Hooks - `useMemo` Hook

### Purpose
The `useMemo` hook allows you to create a memoized value that persists between re-renders. This can be useful for optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary computations.

### Syntax
```typescript
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(), [dependencies]);
```

### Parameters
- `computeExpensiveValue`: A function that computes the memoized value. This function is only called when the dependencies change.
- `dependencies`: An array of dependencies. The memoized value will be recomputed if any of these dependencies change.

### Return Value
The memoized value. This value will persist between re-renders until the dependencies change.

### Usage
The `useMemo` hook can be used to memoize any value that is expensive to compute. For example, you could use it to memoize the result of a complex calculation, or the output of a network request.

Here is an example of how to use the `useMemo` hook to memoize the result of a complex calculation:
```typescript
const calculateExpensiveValue = () => {
  // This function is expensive to compute.
  return Math.pow(10, 100);
};

const App = () => {
  const memoizedValue = useMemo(calculateExpensiveValue, []);

  return (
    <div>
      The memoized value is: {memoizedValue}
    </div>
  );
};
```
In this example, the `calculateExpensiveValue` function is called to compute the memoized value. The second argument to `useMemo` is an empty array, which means that the memoized value will never be recomputed, even if other components in the application re-render.

### Performance Considerations
The `useMemo` hook can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary computations. However, it is important to use it judiciously. If you memoize too many values, it can actually slow down your application.

A good rule of thumb is to only memoize values that are expensive to compute and that do not change frequently.

### Gotchas
- The `useMemo` hook does not perform deep equality checks on the dependencies array. This means that if you pass an object or array as a dependency, it will be re-computed if any of its properties change, even if the object or array itself has not changed.
- The `useMemo` hook does not prevent the memoized value from being recomputed if the component that uses it is re-rendered. If you want to prevent the memoized value from being recomputed, use the `useCallback` hook instead.

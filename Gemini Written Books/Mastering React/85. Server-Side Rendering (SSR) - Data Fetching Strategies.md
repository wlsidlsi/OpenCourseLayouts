**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**

**Definition:**
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique in web development where the HTML for a page is generated on the server before being sent to the client. This contrasts with Client-Side Rendering (CSR), where the HTML is generated on the client's side.

**Data Fetching Strategies with SSR:**

When using SSR, there are several strategies for fetching data from the server before rendering the HTML:

**1. Page Refresh:**
* The simplest strategy, but requires the entire page to be reloaded when data changes.
* Suitable for static or infrequently changing pages.

**2. Server-Side API Calls:**
* Fetch data dynamically from the server using API calls.
* Offers better performance and scalability compared to page refresh.
* Requires a server-side framework that supports API handling.

**3. Data Injection:**
* Load data from the database or API into variables on the server-side.
* These variables are then injected into the HTML before rendering.
* Avoids the need for separate API calls or page refreshes.

**4. Middleware:**
* Intercept requests and modify the HTML before sending it to the client.
* Can be used to fetch and inject data into the HTML.
* Offers flexibility and can be easily integrated with existing applications.

**5. Hooks:**
* Server-side frameworks may provide hooks to fetch and access data before rendering.
* Hooks allow for easy data prefetching and manipulation without modifying the HTML.

**Advantages of SSR:**

* **Improved SEO:** Search engines can crawl and index the content before it reaches the client.
* **Faster initial load times:** The HTML is already generated, reducing the time it takes to display the page.
* **Enhanced accessibility:** Content is available to users without JavaScript enabled.
* **Better user experience:** Smooth navigation and data updates without page refreshes.

**Disadvantages of SSR:**

* **Increased server load:** Can potentially impact server performance if data fetching is not optimized.
* **Limited interactivity:** Interactions may require page refreshes or additional API calls.
* **More complex implementation:** Requires a server-side framework and data fetching strategies.
* **Not suitable for highly dynamic or real-time applications:** Changes to data require additional requests or page refreshes.

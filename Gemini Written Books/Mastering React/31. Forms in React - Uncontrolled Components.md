## Forms in React - Uncontrolled Components

### Overview

Uncontrolled components are form elements that are not controlled by React's state. Instead, their values are managed directly by the DOM. They are not stored in React's state, and React does not update them as the user interacts with them.

### Advantages of Uncontrolled Components

* **Simplicity:** Uncontrolled components are easier to implement than controlled components.
* **Performance:** Uncontrolled components can be more performant than controlled components, especially when dealing with large forms.
* **Non-reactivity:** Uncontrolled components are not affected by React's reactivity, so they can be used in cases where React's state management is not necessary.

### Disadvantages of Uncontrolled Components

* **Lack of control:** React does not control the values of uncontrolled components, so it can be challenging to manage them in more complex scenarios.
* **Limited functionality:** Uncontrolled components cannot provide the same level of functionality as controlled components, such as validation and two-way data binding.

### Using Uncontrolled Components

To create an uncontrolled component, simply use the `ref` attribute to reference the DOM element. You can then access the value of the element by using the `.value` property.

```javascript
import React, { useRef } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  function handleClick() {
    const value = inputRef.current.value;
    // Do something with the value
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Submit</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### When to Use Uncontrolled Components

Uncontrolled components are best suited for simple forms where:

* The form data is not used in complex logic.
* The form is not large and does not require validation.
* Performance is a concern.

### Gotchas

* Uncontrolled components are not reactive, so any changes made to their values will not be reflected in React's state.
* It is important to remember to use the `.value` property to access the value of uncontrolled components, not the `value` attribute.

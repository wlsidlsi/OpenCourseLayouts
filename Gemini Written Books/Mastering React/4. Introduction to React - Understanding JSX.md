**Introduction**
React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's declarative, efficient, and flexible, making it a popular choice for large-scale web applications.

**JSX (JavaScript XML)**
JSX is a syntax extension that allows you to write React components in a way that resembles HTML. It combines the expressiveness of JavaScript with the simplicity of HTML, making it easier to create complex and dynamic user interfaces.

**Structure**
A JSX element consists of a tag, attributes, and content. The following is an example of a simple JSX element:

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
```
**JSX vs HTML**

| Feature | JSX | HTML |
|---|---|---|
| Embedding JavaScript | Yes | No |
| Dynamic attributes | Yes | No |
| Component names | PascalCase | lowercase |
| Closing tags | Only required for self-closing tags | Required for all tags |

**Embedding JavaScript**

One of the key features of JSX is its ability to embed JavaScript expressions within the code. This allows you to create dynamic content that responds to state changes and user interactions. For example:

```jsx
const message = 'Welcome, ' + props.name + '!';
const element = <h1>{message}</h1>;
```

**Dynamic Attributes**

JSX also supports dynamic attributes, which can be changed dynamically based on state or props. For example:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

const Component = () => {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(true);

  return (
    <div className={isVisible ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>
      ...
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Component Names**

In JSX, component names are written in PascalCase, which is the convention for React components. This helps distinguish them from HTML elements, which are written in lowercase. For example:

```jsx
const Header = () => {
  ...
};
```

**Closing Tags**

JSX follows the same closing tag rules as HTML. However, self-closing tags do not require a closing tag. For example:

```jsx
<input type="text" />
```

**Conclusion**

JSX is a powerful syntax extension that makes it easier to build complex and dynamic React user interfaces. It combines the expressiveness of JavaScript with the simplicity of HTML, allowing developers to create flexible and maintainable applications.

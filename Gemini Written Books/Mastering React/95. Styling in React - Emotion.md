**95. Styling in React - Emotion**

## Introduction

Emotion is a performant and flexible CSS-in-JS library for React. It enables developers to write CSS in JavaScript and directly apply it to React components.

## Key Features

* **Per-component styles:** Allows defining styles that are encapsulated to specific components.
* **Scoped styles:** Prevents style conflicts by scoping styles to their component's namespace.
* **Dead code elimination:** Removes unused CSS classes during build time, improving performance.
* **Server-side rendering support:** Enables styling during server-side rendering.
* **Theming:** Supports creating and applying themes across components.

## Usage

### Installation

Install Emotion using npm:

```bash
npm install emotion
```

### Basic Usage

```javascript
import { css } from 'emotion';

const styles = css`
  margin-top: 10px;
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: #eee;
`;

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div className={styles}>Hello World!</div>;
};
```

### Styling with Functions

Emotion supports styling with functions, allowing for dynamic and responsive styles.

```javascript
import { css } from 'emotion';

const styles = css(props => ({
  fontSize: props.fontSize,
  color: props.color,
  margin: '10px 0',
}));

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div className={styles({ fontSize: '16px', color: 'blue' })}>Hello World!</div>;
};
```

### Theming

Emotion supports theming, allowing for consistent styling across multiple components.

```javascript
import { css, ThemeContext } from 'emotion';

const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: 'blue',
    secondary: 'green',
  },
};

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
      <div css={css`
        color: ${props => props.theme.colors.primary};
      `}>Hello World!</div>
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

## Performance Benefits

Emotion improves performance by:

* **Avoiding DOM operations:** Styles are applied to the root element, minimizing DOM manipulations.
* **Inlining CSS:** Styles are inlined into the component's `<style>` tag, reducing network requests.
* **Dead code elimination:** Unused CSS classes are removed during build time, reducing the size of the CSS bundle.

## Conclusion

Emotion is a powerful and versatile CSS-in-JS library for React. Its ease of use, performance benefits, and support for theming make it a valuable tool for building scalable and visually appealing React applications.

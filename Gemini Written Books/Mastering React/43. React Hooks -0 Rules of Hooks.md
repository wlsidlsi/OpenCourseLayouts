**0 Rules of Hooks**

**Introduction:**

React Hooks are a set of functions that allow developers to use state and other React features without writing a class component. To ensure the correct usage of hooks, React has introduced a set of guidelines known as the "0 Rules of Hooks."

**Rule 1: Only Call Hooks at the Top Level**

* Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component, outside of any other functions or loops.
* This ensures that hooks have access to the correct state and props.

**Rule 2: Only Call Hooks from React Functional Components**

* Hooks can only be called within React functional components (functions that start with 'use').
* This is because hooks are closely tied to the component's lifecycle and state.

**Rule 3: Hooks Are Batch Processed**

* When multiple hooks are called in a component, they are batched and executed in the order they are called.
* This means that the state updates from one hook will not affect the execution of subsequent hooks.

**Rule 4: Avoid Calling Hooks Conditionally**

* Hooks should not be called conditionally, as it can lead to unintended state updates.
* Instead, consider using conditional rendering or splitting the component into multiple parts.

**Rule 5: Avoid Side Effects in Hooks**

* Hooks should not be used to perform side effects, such as fetching data or setting timers.
* Side effects should be handled in the `useEffect` hook, which provides a way to run effects after each render.

**Rule 6: Use the Same Hooks in the Same Order**

* Hooks should be called in the same order in each component that uses them.
* This is because the order in which hooks are called determines which values are assigned to each hook.

**Rule 7: Only Access State Directly from Hooks**

* State should only be accessed directly from within hooks.
* This ensures that state updates are performed correctly and that the state is always in sync.

**Rule 8: Only Call Hooks from Custom Hooks**

* Custom hooks can be used to encapsulate complex hook usage.
* However, custom hooks should only be called from other custom hooks or React functional components.

**Conclusion:**

The "0 Rules of Hooks" are essential guidelines that help developers use hooks correctly and avoid common pitfalls. By following these rules, developers can ensure the predictability, consistency, and performance of their React applications.

**Setting Up React Router**

React Router is a powerful library for managing client-side routing in React applications. It enables you to navigate between different components based on the URL.

**Installation**

To install React Router, run the following command:

```
npm install react-router-dom
```

**Creating a Router**

To create a router, wrap your application components in a `<BrowserRouter>` or `<HashRouter>` component. `<BrowserRouter>` uses HTML5's history API, while `<HashRouter>` uses the URL hash fragment.

```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, HashRouter } from "react-router-dom";

const App = () => {
  // ...
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      {/* Your application components */}
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};
```

**Creating Routes**

Routes define the mapping between URLs and components. Create a `<Route>` component for each route you want to support.

```javascript
import { Route } from "react-router-dom";

const App = () => {
  // ...
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};
```

**Navigating Programmatically**

Use the `useHistory` hook to navigate programmatically.

```javascript
import { useHistory } from "react-router-dom";

const handleClick = () => {
  const history = useHistory();
  history.push("/about");
};
```

**Protected Routes**

To restrict access to certain routes based on authentication, use the `<PrivateRoute>` component from a third-party library like react-router-protected.

```javascript
import { PrivateRoute } from "react-router-protected";

const App = () => {
  // ...
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <PrivateRoute path="/admin" component={Admin} />
      <Route path="/public" component={Public} />
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};
```

**404 Page**

Create a custom 404 page by adding a `<Route>` with a `path` of "*".

```javascript
import { Route } from "react-router-dom";

const App = () => {
  // ...
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      {<!-- ... Other routes -->}
      <Route path="*" component={NotFound} />
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};
```

**Additional Considerations**

* **Deployment:** Ensure the server serves the same HTML on every route to prevent 404 errors.
* **Dynamic Routes:** Use the `<useParams>` hook to access route parameters.
* **Nested Routes:** Use nested `<Route>` components to create hierarchical navigation.
* **Query Parameters:** Use the `useLocation` hook to access query parameters.
* **Scroll Management:** Use the `useScroll` hook to control scroll position between routes.

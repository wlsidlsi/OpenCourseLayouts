## 27. Lists and Keys - Using Keys in Lists

In Python, lists can be indexed using keys, similar to dictionaries. However, unlike dictionaries, the keys in lists are limited to integers representing the index of the element in the list.

### Syntax

```python
list[key]
```

where `list` is the list you want to index and `key` is the integer representing the index of the element.

### Examples

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Access the first element using key 0
first_element = my_list[0]

# Access the last element using negative key -1
last_element = my_list[-1]

# Access the third element using key 2
third_element = my_list[2]
```

### Use Cases

Using keys in lists can be useful in various scenarios:

- **Accessing elements quickly:** Instead of iterating through the list to find the desired element, you can directly access it using its index.
- **Deleting elements:** You can use the `del` keyword followed by the key to delete an element from the list.
- **Modifying elements:** You can assign a new value to the element at the specified key.
- **Sorting lists:** Lists can be sorted based on the elements at specific keys using the `sort()` method.
- **Slicing lists:** You can use keys to slice a list and create a new list with a subset of elements.

### Note

It's important to remember that the keys in lists are zero-indexed, meaning the first element in the list has a key of 0. Also, accessing elements beyond the valid range of keys (negative keys less than -len(list) or positive keys greater than or equal to len(list)) will raise an `IndexError`.

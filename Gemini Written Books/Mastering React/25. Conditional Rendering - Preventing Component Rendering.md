## 25. Conditional Rendering - Preventing Component Rendering

### Overview

Conditional rendering allows you to control whether or not a component is rendered based on certain conditions. This is useful for displaying or hiding content based on user interactions, data availability, or other factors.

### Common Use Cases

* Showing or hiding elements based on user actions (e.g., clicking a button)
* Displaying different content depending on the data available
* Preventing components from rendering until necessary (to improve performance)

### Implementation Techniques

**1. Inline Conditional Rendering**

```js
render() {
  if (condition) {
    return <Component />;
  } else {
    return null;
  }
}
```

**2. Conditional Statements**

```js
render() {
  return (
    {condition ? <Component /> : null}
  );
}
```

**3. Ternary Operator**

```js
render() {
  return condition ? <Component /> : null;
}
```

**4. && Operator**

```js
render() {
  return condition && <Component />;
}
```

**5. Short-Circuiting**

```js
render() {
  const element = condition && <Component />;
  return element;
}
```

### Best Practices

* Use conditional rendering sparingly to improve performance.
* Consider using the && operator instead of conditional statements for performance optimization.
* Keep the conditions simple and easy to understand.
* Avoid using conditional rendering for complex logic.

### Additional Notes

* Conditional rendering is a powerful tool, but it should be used judiciously.
* It can improve the user experience by making your components more responsive.
* It can also improve performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

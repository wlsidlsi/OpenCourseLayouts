**3. Introduction to React - Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Prerequisites**

* Node.js (v14 or later)
* npm (comes with Node.js)

**Steps to Set Up the Environment:**

**1. Install Node.js and npm**

- Visit the Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest stable version for your operating system.
- Follow the installation instructions provided.

**2. Install Create React App (CRA)**

- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Install CRA globally using npm:
```
npm install -g create-react-app
```
- Alternatively, you can use yarn to install CRA:
```
yarn global add create-react-app
```

**3. Create a New React Project**

- Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
- Create a new project using CRA:
```
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```
where `my-react-app` is the name of your project.

**4. Start the Development Server**

- Go to the project directory:
```
cd my-react-app
```
- Start the development server:
```
npm start
```
or
```
yarn start
```

**5. Open the Project in Code Editor**

- The project will be opened in your default code editor.
- If the project does not open automatically, open it manually in your preferred editor.

**Output**

After following these steps, you should see the React development server running at `http://localhost:3000`. You will also have a fully functional React project open in your code editor.

**Troubleshooting**

* **Error: Command not found**
  - Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed correctly.
* **Error: Unable to install create-react-app**
  - Ensure that you have sufficient permissions to install global packages.
* **Development server not starting**
  - Check if the project directory contains a `package.json` file and a `node_modules` directory.
* **Code editor not opening automatically**
  - Configure your code editor to automatically open newly created projects.

**Next Steps**

After setting up the development environment, explore the basics of React in the following sections:

* Components and Props
* State and Lifecycle
* Events and Event Handling
* Conditional Rendering
* Styling
